Overview

The Boomi Atomsphere API provides direct access to API Objects and API Actions. This service makes it possible to build no-code Boomi DevOps workflows and operations dashboards for Boomi environments. For more information please refer to the API documentation:

## Features
The Boomi Atomsphere service forms part of the following features within flow:

### Database
This service feature allows you to connect to a dozens of Boomi object types and perform save, load and delete operations. Filters and sorting are supported. Examples include querying process execution history, creating a deployment on an Atom or querying the Boomi audit log for administrative changes. Note not all object fields are filterable. Using non-supported fields in condition will result in an error message when executing the flow. For more information regarding the capabilities of an API object, please refer to the help documentation specified in the Overview section of this document.

### Message
This service feature allows you to connect to Boomi API actions. Examples include actions for executing a process or canceling a process execution

### Identity
This service feature allows you to use Boomi Atomsphere as an identity system within flow. This supports building applications where users can log in using their Boomi Atomsphere username and password.

## Known limitations
* Unsupported API Object Types
 * API Manager Plan Usage object
* Unsupported API Actions
 * API Manager Add Plans to Deployments
 * API Manager Remove Plans from Deployments
 * API Manager Send Changes to Authentication Source
* Pagination limitations - The underlying API paginates rows 100 at a time. It uses “token” pagination whereas Flow only supports offset pagination. 
* Sorting limitations - The underlying API does not support sorting. When sorting is enabled, a maximum of 5000 rows are queried and then sorted before returning a page to Flow.
* Maximum return rows - The Data service allows returning a maximum 5000 rows. If your object contains more objects, implement filters to limit the returned data set.
